Welcome to the **Bento Grid** project! This is a responsive web design challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). The goal of this project is to create a visually appealing and fully responsive bento-style grid layout using modern web technologies.

## Overview

This project is a solution to the **Bento Grid** challenge from Frontend Mentor.
